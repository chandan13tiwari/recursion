# recursion-summary

* Steps to solve any recursion problem - 
    1. *Analyze the Problem statement* - try to identify if recursion will be used in the given problem statement or not.
  2. *Create recursive tree first* - Always create the tree first before implementing your recursive method.
  3. *Trust your Recursive method* - Think recursively. Don't bother about the values while writing your recursive method. Just write what you think recursive and trust your method.
  4. *Calculate partial answer* - Be lazy. Try to calculate the partial answer. Partial answer means, the thing which you want someone will do it for you, and "someone" here is your recursive method. And just simply do the last operation by yourself.
  5. *Clean your mess* - Always remember to "backtrack". Means, if you have made some changes, then remember to undo those changes for the next iteration.
  6. *Base cases* - Don't forgot to add the base cases to break the iteration. Otherwise, you'll get the wrong answers.
